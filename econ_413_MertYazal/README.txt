Dear Erol Hoca,

My Contribution:

In the begging of the term, I have put 10 hours in order to understand the project. In my former project, I have worked in the former project, with my friends, 
I have put additional 20 hours to start project, importing, cleaning, rewriting the data, and and write it, learn plot.ly and potentially useful packages
Sadly, after I decided to move on from my friends, I had to dump the old project and redo all the project myself from the scratch again, 
I have put at least 50 hours on this project, done the whole of it. I have mostly struggled with coding/synthax part.

Total: 80 hours. 

-As you have demanded, BACI dataset was used.
-We have aimed to used the following charts and plots
Line chart
Bar chart
Bubble chart 
Tree map
Scatter plots
-Classification is via HS96 codes.
-Only yet have line chart, bar chart and tree map been used.

Kind Regards.

Letter:

Dear Professor Erol Hoca,

I have sent a detailed letter to you at the 10th of June, as you may remember. I had already started for my own project before then. As you have demanded for a clarification, I will summarize the reasons from my side why I decided to split up
from my friends, group5:

To summarize the reasons:

1- Not answering whatsapp group texts, class-related publications regarding the project

As time passed and I got discouraged of my colleagues, I stopped taking initiative of the group: 
No surprise: no progress was made since I stopped taking initiative until May 20, one day before the first presentation.

2- Not taking initiative 
3- Not being interested at project at all
       -first presentation was made one day before the presentation day
       -final presentation started last Friday, 14th of June.

4- Taking the top three items into consideration, my group put me under obstacle rather than each of us should be supporting one another.
As you have mentioned, one of the fostering aspects of team work is to learn from each other. 

After I stopped initiative, no one ever texted anything to the group about R project since then except before the first presentation and final project.

I am sorry for having created an extraordinary situation and I am personally very sad about this outcome for two reasons. 
First, I could learn a lot more out of this class with collaborative colleagues or with my friends.
Second, I had to waste the most of my time understanding/solving the easy/repetitive syntax which would be done a lot faster with colleagues. This constrained me to do a more challenging project thus have an A grade.


I have also sent your e-mail to them about a brief explanation of the issue.

Kind Regards.
