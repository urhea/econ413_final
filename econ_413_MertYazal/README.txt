Dear Erol Hoca,

My Contribution:

In the begging of the term, I have put 10 hours in order to understand the project. In my former project, I have worked in the former project, with my friends, 
I have put additional 20 hours to start project, importing, cleaning, rewriting the data, and and write it, learn plot.ly and potentially useful packages
Sadly, after I decided to move on from my friends, I had to dump the old project and redo all the project myself from the scratch again, 
I have put at least 50 hours on this project, done the whole of it. I have mostly struggled with coding/synthax part.

Total: 80 hours. 

-As you have demanded, BACI dataset was used.
-We have aimed to used the following charts and plots
Line chart
Bar chart
Bubble chart 
Tree map
Scatter plots
-Classification is via HS96 codes.
-Only yet have line chart, bar chart and tree map been used.

Kind Regards.
